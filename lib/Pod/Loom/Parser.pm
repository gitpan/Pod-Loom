=head1 NAME

Pod::Loom::Parser - Subclass Pod::Eventual for Pod::Loom

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.03 of
Pod::Loom::Parser, released March 6, 2010
as part of Pod-Loom version 0.03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pod::Loom::Parser;

  my $parser = Pod::Loom::Parser->new( ['head1'] );
  $parser->read_file('lib/Foo/Bar.pm');
  my $collectedHash = $parser->collected;

  foreach my $block (@{ $collectedHash->{head1} }) {
    printf "---\n%s\n", $block;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pod::Loom::Parser is a subclass of L<Pod::Eventual> intended for use
by L<Pod::Loom::Template>.  It breaks the POD into chunks based on a
list of POD commands.  Each chunk begins with one of the commands, and
contains all the POD up until the next selected command.

The commands do not need to be valid POD commands.  You can invent
commands like C<=attr> or C<=method>.

=head1 METHODS

See L<Pod::Eventual> for the C<read_handle>, C<read_file>, and
C<read_string> methods, which you use to feed POD into the parser.

=head2 new

  $parser = Pod::Loom::Parser->new(\@collect_commands);

Constructs a new Pod::Loom::Parser.  You pass it an arrayref of the
POD commands at which the POD should be chopped.


=head2 collected

  $hashRef = $parser->collected;

This returns the POD chunks that the document was chopped into.  There
is one entry for each of the C<@collect_commands> that were passed to
the constructor.  The value is an arrayref of strings, one for each
time that command appeared in the document.  Each chunk contains all
the text from the command up to (but not including) the command that
started the next chunk.  Chunks appear in document order.

If one of the commands did not appear in the document, its value will
be an empty arrayref.

In addition, any POD targeted to a format matching C</^Pod::Loom\b/>
will be collected under the format name.


=head2 groups

  $hashRef = $parser->groups;

This returns a hashref with one entry for each of the
C<@collect_commands>.  Each value is a hashref whose keys are the
categories used with that command.  For example, if C<attr> was a
collected command, and the document contained these entries:

  =attr-foo attr1
  =attr-bar attr2
  =attr-foo attr3
  =attr attr4

then C<< keys %{ $parser->groups->{attr} } >> would return C<bar> and
C<foo>.  (The C<=attr> without a category does not get an entry in
this hash.)

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Pod::Loom::Parser requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Pod::Loom::Parser requires L<Pod::Eventual>, which can be found on CPAN.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
