=head1 NAME

Pod::Loom::Template::Identity - Do-nothing template for Pod::Loom

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.03 of
Pod::Loom::Template::Identity, released October 15, 2011
as part of Pod-Loom version 0.05.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the simplest possible template for L<Pod::Loom>.  It does
absolutely nothing to the collected POD.  The result is simply to
collect all POD sections and move them to the end of the file.

It demonstrates that a Pod::Loom template does not have to be a
subclass of L<Pod::Loom::Template>, and doesn't even need to use L<Moose>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  $template = Pod::Loom::Template::Identity->new($data);

A template must have a constructor named C<new> that takes one argument.
(In this case, we discard it.)


=head2 weave

  $new_pod = $template->weave(\$old_pod, $filename);

A template must also have a C<weave> method that returns the new POD.
The Identity template simply returns the POD unchanged.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
